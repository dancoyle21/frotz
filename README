Experimental build of "frotz" for x64 platforms.

frotz and a C library (uClibc) are statically linked as
position-independent code within a binary blob.

frotz can run on any operating system that runs on x64, provided
that a loader is written for that operating system. Currently
Windows and Linux are supported. Support for TempleOS is in progress. 


TempleOS doesn't support SSE2 so the program must use 387 FPU instructions.
