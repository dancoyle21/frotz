Experimental build of "frotz" for x64 platforms.

frotz and a C library (uClibc) are statically linked as
position-independent code within a binary blob.

frotz can run on any operating system that runs on x64, provided
that a loader is written for that operating system. Currently
Windows and Linux are supported.
