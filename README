Experimental build of "frotz" for x64 platforms.

frotz and a C library (uClibc) are statically linked as
position-independent code within a binary blob.

frotz can run on any operating system that runs on x64, provided
that a loader is written for that operating system. Currently
Windows and Linux are supported.

Support for TempleOS is in progress. However, SSE2 instructions
are not supported on TempleOS:

000000000000cbe0 <dumb_init_input>:
    cbe0:       48 8b 05 21 39 01 00    mov    0x13921(%rip),%rax        # 20508 <rv_names
    +0xc8>
    cbe7:       0f b6 00                movzbl (%rax),%eax
    cbea:       3c 03                   cmp    $0x3,%al
    cbec:       76 26                   jbe    cc14 <dumb_init_input+0x34>
    cbee:       0f 57 c0                xorps  %xmm0,%xmm0
    cbf1:       0f 2e 05 48 40 01 00    ucomiss 0x14048(%rip),%xmm0        # 20c40 <speed>
    cbf8:       7b 26                   jnp    cc20 <dumb_init_input+0x40>

cbee triggers an invalid opcode fault.
